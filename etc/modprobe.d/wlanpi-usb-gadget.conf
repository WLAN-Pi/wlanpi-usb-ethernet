# Prevent dwc2 from auto-loading - usb-ethernet-gadget.sh loads dwc2
# after configuring the gadget to ensure proper USB enumeration
# with picky USB hosts (e.g., Surface Laptop 7)
#
# See: RPi commit 11919d5 (June 2025) changed DWC2 from module to built-in,
# which caused enumeration failures because DWC2 initializes before the
# gadget is configured. By blacklisting and loading manually, we ensure
# the USB host sees a fully-configured device from the start.
blacklist dwc2
